# simple-bank-simulation
This program is a simple bank simulation to enable a user to create a pin protected account, make deposits and withdrawals, and view the account balance. All account data are stored in a text file for easy access and update. This program was built to expand my knowledge on file handling techniques and use of standard python libraries
